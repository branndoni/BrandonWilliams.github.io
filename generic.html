									<h1>Brandon Williams<br />

								<p>Im an early adopter. So whether its the new graphics card or the latest AI thats coming out or whether its the new nintendo thats coming out, Im on it. Im an early adopter, and the reason why im telling you this is because I know that you need someone whos not just saying the right things and talking about technology. You want someone who's actually living and breating things that are just coming out. I dont wait until its cheaper, I dont wait until its been in the market for 3 or 4 years and I dont wait for tutorials. Im the first one waiting in line. Im the first one learning to use it. And when Nintendo releases their new Switch you can bet im going to be waiting in line to get it early in the morning. Im constantly trying to learn new things. I know that in this field you will never stop learning new things, and that is the environment that I love to be a part of.</p>
								<p>How I got into studying data and software development is an unusual one. I was a competitive Pokemon player. If you're familiar with the game you know that you have to constantly learn, constantly switch your style, study your team, meta, and every Pokemon and the format of the game is always changing. I wanted to find my own way of getting ahead of the crowd, and that is when I learned about data sets and SQL which I used to improve the performance of my team against other teams. I didn't realize it at the time, but that set me on a path. I want to learn as much as my brain can handle about different programming languages, create projects, work with more data, win Pokemon tournaments and hone my skillset. Maybe in the future I could even create my own game.</p>
